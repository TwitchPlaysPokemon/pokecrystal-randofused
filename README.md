# Pokémon Fused Crystal

To make Pokémon Fused Crystal, we ran xCrystal's Randofuser on top of erudnick-cohen's Crystal Item Randomizer, and then added our own extra touches to create a wholly surreal Johto and Kanto experience. Key items and badges are no longer where you expect them to be, and there's a whole new roster of 251 fused Pokémon to see.

Encounter brand new Pokémon formed out of two familiar species! Explore and discover your own path through a wintery Johto and Kanto! And if you get lost, don't worry. We've brought along an old friend to help.
